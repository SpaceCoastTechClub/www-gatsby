## Code of Conduct

The Space Coast Tech Club Slack Community exists to provide a space for individuals who live in the
Space Coast region to communicate, interact, share interesting ideas, and support each other in
achieving their goals.

We hope to create an environment in which all individuals can participate in a positive and
affirming way. Behavior that contributes to this sort of environment includes using welcoming and
inclusive language, being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, gracefully accepting
constructive criticism, focusing on what is best for the community at large, and showing empathy
towards other community members.

The Space Coast Tech Club Slack Community is committed to providing an experience that is safe and
free from harassment or offense for everyone, regardless of personal attributes such as gender,
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. We expect members to
act in good faith to avoid intentionally offending others.

This code of conduct applies to all public and private channels as well as direct messages. Anyone
who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion
of the admins.

If you are being harassed or offended by a member of the community, notice that someone else is
being harassed or offended, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins by emailing admin at thisdomain.
